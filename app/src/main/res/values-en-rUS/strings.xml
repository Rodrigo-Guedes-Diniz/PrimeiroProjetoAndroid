         pavement of the roads in Recife, bringing agility in directing these demands to the competent bodies?
            This is OurStreet. An application that shows you how are the streets and roads on which you
             intend to travel. The application works like this: When a user sees an occurrence (hole, work,
              etc.) he can report it by marking it on the map so that the next users can find out about it and if
               schedule in advance, diverting the route or leaving home earlier. That is, if you
                come across an occurrence, you can help everyone else by reporting. But not only other users who
                 you can be helping, but also the city hall, which can access the application and find out at
                  real time of what is happening to send a team to solve the problem, so everyone leaves
                   winning.</string>
